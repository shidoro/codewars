# Description

This lesson we learn two methods of array: `reduce()` and `reduceRight()`. The two method is approximate. It applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array to reduce it to a single value. The only difference is: the order of `reduce()` is from left to right, but `reduceRight()` is from right to left.

For more information, please refer to:

- [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
- [Array.prototype.reduceRight()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceRight)

Before looking at some examples, we need to understand that the callback function used for the `reduce()` can use up to 4 parameters: `previousValue`, `currentValue`, `index` and `array`. In general, we use only two parameters: `previousValue` and `currentValue`. `index` and `array` are optional, and we use it when necessary.

Here are some examples to help us understand the use of `reduce()` and reduceRight():

The first is a classic example, we can use `reduce()` method to get the sum of the number array:

```js
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr)); //output: 15
//My habit is to use a and b
console.log(arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b)); //output: 15
```

In addition to the callback function, `reduce()` also has an optional parameter: `initialvalue`. In the example above, the `initialvalue` is omitted. Then the `initialvalue` is the first element, and then start the cumulative operation from second element.

The following example uses the `initialvalue`:

```js
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, "")); //output: 12345
```

This example uses an empty string as the `initialvalue`, followed by these operation:

```js
""+1-->"1","1"+2-->"12",......,"1234"+5-->"12345"
```

As long as you have enough imagination, `reduce()` can do a lot of work.

Calculated average:

```js
function average(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / arr.length;
}
console.log(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); //output: 3
```

Count something

```js
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//count odd number:
console.log(arr.reduce((a, b) => a + (b % 2 ? 1 : 0), 0)); //output: 3
//count even number:
console.log(arr.reduce((a, b) => a + (b % 2 ? 0 : 1), 0)); //output: 2
```

The following is a complex example, which uses a callback function of the four parameters and the initialvalue:

```js
var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var result = arr1
  .map((x) => x * x)
  .reduce((a, b, i, ar) => a.concat(ar[i], arr2[i]), []);
console.log(result); //output: [ 1, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 16, 9, 25, 10 ]
```

In the example above, Arr1 uses the map method to turn each element into its square.

```js
[1,2,3,4,5]--->[1,4,9,16,25]
```

Then, using the reduce method. the two elements (`ar[i]` and `arr2[i]`) of the same index in turn are put into the initial value (an empty array).

```js
[1,4,9,16,25]
                ---> [ 1, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 16, 9, 25, 10 ]
[6,7,8,9,10]
```

It should be noted that when reading the value of the first array, we used the `ar[i]` (fourth parameters of the callback function). This value is changed by the `map()` method([1,4,9,16,25]). If we used `arr1[i]` reading the value, will be the value of the original array([1,2,3,4,5])

Ok, lesson is over. let's us do some task.

## Task

Coding in function `tailAndHead`. function accept 1 parameter `arr`(a number array).

We use an example to explain this task:

You got an array `[123,456,789,12,34,56,78]`.

First, from left to right, the tail of an element and the head of the next element are added together. The results are put into an array. like this:

```js
[123,456,789,1 2,3 4,5 6,78]
   3+4 6+7 9+1 2+3 4+5 6+7
    |   |   |   |   |   |
   [7 ,13 ,10 , 5 , 9 ,13]
```

And then, Calculate their product and return it(`7x13x10x5x9x13=532350`)

So, `tailAndHead([123,456,789,12,34,56,78]) should return 532350`

All elements of arr are positive integer. If a number is less than 10, its head and tail are the same. Please try to use `reduce()` solve this kata.

Examples

```js
tailAndHead([1,2,3,4,5]) should return 945
tailAndHead([111,2345,66,78,900]) should return 7293
tailAndHead([35456,782,569,2454,875]) should return 12012
```

---

## Solution

```js
const tailAndHead = (arr) =>
  arr.reduce(
    (acc, v, i) => (i && (acc *= +(v + "")[0] + (arr[i - 1] % 10)), acc),
    1
  );
```
