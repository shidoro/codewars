# Description

This lesson we learn two methods of array: `every()` and `some()`. The `every()` method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. The `some()` method tests whether some element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

For more information, please refer to:

[Array.prototype.every()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every)
[Array.prototype.some()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some)

Here are some examples to help us understand the use of `every()` and `some()`:

`every()` always return a boolean value. It executes the callback function to each element in turn, if one of the returns is false, then `every()` returns false; if all returns true, then `every()` returns true.

```js
var a=[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(a.every(x=>x>0)); //output: true
                              all elements >0
console.log(a.every(x=>x>1)); //output: false
                              a[0]==1, so every() should return false
```

`some()` and `every()` are opposite. `some()` executes the callback function to each element in turn, if one of the returns is true, then `some()` returns true; if all returns false, then `some()` returns false.

```js
var a=[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(a.some(x=>x>4)); //output: true
                             a[4]>4 so some() should return true
console.log(a.some(x=>x>5)); //output: false
                             all elements <=5
```

Their behavior seems to be a traversal of an array and with a break statement(When every meet false, or when the some meet true, they will jump out of the traversal of the array):

```js
var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
a.every((x) => {
  console.log(x);
  return x < 4;
});
//output:
1;
2;
3;
4;
```

We can see that console.log runs 4 times. When the element=4, `x<4` return false, so `every()` out of the array traversal. The same situation also occurs in the some method. We can use this feature to do some work.

The following example will look for a pair of adjacent numbers in the array, and their sum is equal to 15:

```js
var a = 0,
  b = 0,
  arr = [3, 6, 9, 6, 9, 3];
arr.some((x, i) => {
  a = arr[i]; //or a=x
  b = arr[i + 1];
  return a + b == 15;
});
console.log(a, b); //output: 6 9
```

When the `some()` method meets the appropriate value, the `a+b==15` returns true, the some function exits the loop, so we get the two values. And once again we see two parameters being used. Yes, it is the same as the `map()` method, the callback function can have up to three parameters: currentValue (required),index (optional) and array (optional). The usage is similar to the `map()` method, so I'm no longer crap ;-)

Ok, lesson is over. let's us do some task.

## Task

Coding in function `mirrorImage`. function accept 1 parameter `arr`, it's a number array. Your task is find the first pair of mirror-image number and return as an array. The two number must be adjacent, and the returned array is in accordance with the order from left to right.

What's the mirror-image number? for example:`123` and `321` is a pair of mirror-image number. Two the same number of palindromes can also be seen as a pair of mirror-image number, such as `121` and `121`.

If no such number is found, return`[-1,-1]`

Some example:

```js
mirrorImage([11,22,33,33,22,11]) should return [33,33]
mirrorImage([454,86,57,75,16,88]) should return [57,75]
mirrorImage([454,0,57,0,16,88]) should return [-1,-1]
```

---

## Solution

```js
const mirrorImage = (arr, idx) =>
  arr.some(
    (n, i) => ((idx = i), n + "" === [...(arr[++i] + "")].reverse().join``)
  )
    ? [arr[idx], arr[++idx]]
    : [-1, -1];
```
